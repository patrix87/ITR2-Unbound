# ITR2-Unbound

ITR2-Unbound enhances gameplay by providing features such as infinite stamina, infinite health, no hunger, access level control, money addition, no clip mode, and debug mode. It allows players to customize their experience with various cheats and debugging tools.

## How to Install

1. Requires [UE4SS](https://www.nexusmods.com/intotheradius2/mods/20).
2. Place the `ITR2-Unbound` folder into `/Mods`.
3. Final folder structure should be something like this: `...\Steam\steamapps\common\IntoTheRadius2\IntoTheRadius2\Binaries\Win64\ue4ss\Mods\ITR2-Unbound\scripts\main.lua`

## Features

- Infinite Stamina and No Hunger
- No Hunger
- Infinite Health
- Access Level Control
- Add Money
- No Clip Mode
- Debug Mode

Lots of other features are in the code but commented out because, as far as I can tell, they don't do anything, feel free to experiment.

## Key Mappings

- **D**: Debug mode (show console output in the ue4ss console)
- **0**: Set Access Level to 0
- **1**: Set Access Level to 1
- **2**: Set Access Level to 2
- **3**: Set Access Level to 3
- **M**: Add 10000$ (You must change location for the amount to update.)
- **C**: Toggle No Clip
- **S**: Infinite Stamina and No Hunger
- **H**: No Hunger
- **L**: God Mode (Very fast health regen, not actually immortal.)
- **J**: Toggle Allow Jump (Not sure what that is for.)

## Motivations

The ITR2-Unbound mod was created to alleviate the frustration caused by the Stamina and Hunger mechanics in "Into the Radius 2," especially in a VR setting where these limitations can feel overly restrictive. These mechanics can induce feelings of claustrophobia and unease, detracting from the overall experience. The ability to toggle these features off provides a more enjoyable and less frustrating gameplay experience.

Additionally, constantly running is not advisable as it increases the risk of getting killed or running into artifacts, which already slows you down, making the stamina mechanic somewhat redundant.

Additional features were added later as they were available in the code and could be useful, particularly for subsequent playthroughs. This is especially relevant since the game is in early access and save game files are often wiped.

**It is recommended not to use the mod during the first playthrough to provide the developers with relevant feedback.**
